# Chapter 1 Summary

## OO (Object Oriented) Basics
1. Abstraction
2. Encapsulation
3. Polymorphism
4. Inheritance

## OO Principles
1. Encapsulate what varies.
2. Favor composition over inheritance.
    * This was demonstrated when we constructed a Duck implementation by choosing and injecting the algorithms
      for flying and quacking.
    * The pattern that we used is known as the **Strategy Pattern**
3. Program to interfaces, not implementations.

## OO Patterns

### Strategy Pattern
The Strategy Pattern defines a family of algorithms, encapsulates each one, and makes them interchangeable. 
Strategy lets the algorithm vary independently of the clients that use it.

## Other Tips
* Design patterns give you a shared vocabulary with other developers.
* Knowing OO basics is not enough to be great at building flexible, reusable and maintainable systems.
